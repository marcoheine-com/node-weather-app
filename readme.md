# Node Weather App

This is a small node application which uses the [OpenWeather API](http://openweathermap.org/API) to get
and display weather data for a specific city. Several data attributes will be displayed like the min
and max temperature, information about the wind and clouds and the current temperature. 

This application was developed to get started with node and learn more about how node works.

## Usage
To use this weather application you just have to navigate to the poject folder and type 

```
node weather.js stuttgart
```

You can exchange Stuttgart with every city name you want to get weather information for.
